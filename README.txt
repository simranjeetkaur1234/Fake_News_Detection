# Fake News Detection Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a study on detecting fake news using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The project compares the efficacy of traditional ML models with advanced DL models to identify deceptive content on social media platforms.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to explore various ML and DL techniques to accurately detect fake news articles. By employing models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), this research seeks to understand which models perform best in differentiating between true and fabricated content.

## Dataset

The research utilizes the ISOT Fake News Dataset, which is sourced from Mendeley Data. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the performance of the machine learning models used in this study.

### Dataset Details
