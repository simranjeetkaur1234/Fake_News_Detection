# Fake News Detection Project

## Overview
This project uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect fake news. It compares different models to see which is most effective at identifying fake articles.

## How It Works
- We use models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, CNN, and LSTM.
- The project is based on a dataset that includes both real and fake news articles.

## Files in This Repository
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `models/`: Stores the trained models (note: large files might not be uploaded here).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with all the coding and testing.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages needed to run the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` directory to train the models.
